Target: New NADE class that models an autoregressive network on spins with dependencies only on nearest
and next nearest neighbours

Strategy:
- Create a map to go between C ordered 2D positions and flattened 1D positions for a spin in
the lattice
- In the loss function, add terms to regularize the weights corresponding to farther spins. The
farther the spin, more severely regularized its weight be...
- Alter the mask variable used in NADE_fast class to include the positions of only nearby spins, which
means one spin would depend on atmost 8 nearby spins.
- There won't be any shared weights- each spin would have its own network acting on the restricted set
of dependecies.
